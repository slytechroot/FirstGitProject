### This is my second GitHub.ðŸ‘‹

The scripts you will find in my repos have been gathered over the years for eventual usage in projects, labs, POCs, POVs, pentests, etc. Please use caution and remember - it is YOUR responsibility to READ the code before you execute them and you decide how you use them.
Scripts and articles date back to Windows 2000-XP days, so they are not the most modern, so improving them is your responsibility. 


Here are some ideas to get you started:
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on my SANS SEC699 course and labs <BR>
-  Follow me on Your Tube for quick lessons:<BR>
