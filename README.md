### This is my second GitHub.ðŸ‘‹

The scripts you will find in my repos have been gathered over the years for eventual usage in projects, labs, POCs, POVs, pentests, etc. <BR> Please use caution and remember - it is YOUR responsibility to READ the code before you execute them and you decide how you use them.
Scripts and articles date back to Windows 2000-XP days, so they are not the most modern, so improving them is your responsibility. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:
